Education Resources Customizer
------------------------------

This is a Python CLI app to recommend educational resources based on subject & difficulty.
It reads from a CSV file, filters the data, and shows results with an optional visualization.

Challenges:
- Ensuring case-insensitive matches for user input
- Designing a clean CSV structure

Future Improvements:
- Add a web interface
- Allow users to add resources dynamically
